Greetings and welcome to <strong>Hungry, So Angry</strong>, a blog with very humble beginnings back in 2015. I started this as a private blog, where I gathered recipes for weekend meals to wow! my wife and myself. I had a few changes along the way before I decided to share it with more than just a handfull of people. 

I love to cook, I love to create and I love to share these things with everyone. So please take a look around at some great recipes from around the web to my own personal recipes. 

<strong>Q &amp; A</strong>
