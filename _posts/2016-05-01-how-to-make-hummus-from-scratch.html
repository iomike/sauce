<blockquote>I'm fairly convinced that hummus is some of the best stuff on earth. It might look beige and boring in the bowl, but this blend of soft chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic creates a dip that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Skip the store bought stuff — making it yourself is so easy and will be far tastier than just about anything from the deli section.</p></blockquote>
