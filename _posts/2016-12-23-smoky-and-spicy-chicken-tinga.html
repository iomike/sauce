<blockquote>Here's chicken tinga at its most basic: Simmer chicken breasts or thighs with tomatoes, onions, and aromatics in water. Pur√©e the tomato and onions with chipotle chilies. Shred the chicken, and stir it all together. It's tasty made this way, but I wondered if I could improve it with just a few minor tweaks, while not making the recipe significantly more inconvenient. The result is a one-pot dish that will blow you away with flavor.</p></blockquote>

<p>I tried this out and added sweet potatoes. Great recipe and great tasting.</p>
