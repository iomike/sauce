<blockquote>Here's chicken tinga at its most basic: Simmer chicken breasts or thighs with tomatoes, onions, and aromatics in water. Purée the tomato and onions with chipotle chilies. Shred the chicken, and stir it all together. It's tasty made this way, but I wondered if I could improve it with just a few minor tweaks, while not making the recipe significantly more inconvenient. The result is a one-pot dish that will blow you away with flavor.</p></blockquote>

<p>I tried this out and added sweet potatoes. Great recipe and great tasting.</p>
