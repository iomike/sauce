<p>I made this and followed the recipe closely. I take offence at the title, it's not a "shortcut". I'll make this again but I would definitely make some changes.</p>
<p>Next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>skip the breadcrumbs</li>
<li>use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. We found it was dryer than expected.</li>
<li>incorporate thinly sliced potatoes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not into "deconstructed" recipes but you could separate this easily into a potato side with the meat/eggplant/sliced potato/onion mix.</p>
