<blockquote>For all the times I have ordered chicken lettuce wraps at Chinese restaurants like P.F. Chang's, inhaled entire "appetizers" by myself, and sighed with happiness while licking sticky sauce from my fingers, it never once occurred to me to try making this dish at home. Partly, lettuce wraps have always felt like an indulgence that needed restriction to restaurant visits only. Partly, I assumed that the secret to their deliciousness surely lay in a long list of ingredients, fussy technique, or both. You see where I'm heading here, yes? We can definitely make chicken lettuce wraps at home. It's actually super easy and makes a surprisingly quick and healthy weeknight meal. Pick up what you need on your way home, and you can have these for dinner tonight.</p></blockquote>
