<blockquote>I don't know what I like better: the collard greens, the rich pot liquor orÂ digging out the bits of smoky meat from the ham hock! The Collard Greens recipe is from my good friend and fellow food blogger, Lisa Fain, who writes the blog, Homesick Texan. She's a 7th generation Texan who moved to New York City for a job and one day found herself scouring the city in search of Ro-Tel tomatoes, the only brand of tomatoes fit for true Tex-Mex Chile Con Queso. Of course, she couldn't find any, and thus the Homesick Texan blog was born. Lisa</p></blockquote>
