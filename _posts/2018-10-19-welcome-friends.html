Greetings and welcome to <strong>Hungry, So Angry</strong>, a blog with very humble beginnings back in 2015. I started this as a private blog, where I gathered recipes for weekend meals to wow! my wife and myself. I had a few changes along the way before I decided to share it with more than just a handfull of people. 

I love to cook, I love to create and I love to share these things with everyone. So please take a look around at some great recipes from around the web to my own personal recipes. 

<strong>Q &amp; A</strong>

Q. What's with the title, "Hungry, So Angry"?
A. It's the third name for the blog. The blog went from being recipebox to being Cornbread Kelley to the Sunday Sauce and I never found one with the attitude I wanted this place to have. 

One day, I'm listening to a great Spotify playlist and "Hungry, So Angry" by Medium Medium came on. It's a Post-Punk/New Wave song from 1981 that had a great title and honestly, I hope you enjoy it like I do.
