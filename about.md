I'm based in beautiful Chattanooga, Tennessee and some of being Southern will come out in what we cook.

This site is just a private little corner of the web where I file recipes, restaurants I like, recipes I wanna try, and various links to foodie stuff around the web.

We don't sous vide and we don't do molecular gastronomy, if that's your thing that's fine. I like and make simple food.

**Four rules for how I write on the site.**

 
1.  ~~It's going to~~  Be simple.
2.  Be friendly.
3.  Be *real*.
4.  Be positive.
 
**Guidelines**


 * Talk up, not down. It's just food. (see rule #2)
 * A photo (when possible).
 * I will not make up new words (E-V-O-O? WTF?) (see rules #1 & 3)
 * Sponsored posts will be marked as such. (see rule #3)
 * No politics or religion, unless it relates to food. (see rule #2)
 * Bad restaurants, vendors, or producers will not be mentioned. (rule #2)
